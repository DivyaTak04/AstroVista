# AstroVista
AstroVista is a responsive web application that fetches and displays daily astronomy data using NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. Built as part of my internship, the project showcases API integration, modern UI design, and additional features like image viewer, responsive layout, and enhanced user experience.
